1.Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. 
Explain how they work and what the output was.

$ sort bash.js
//evaluateCmd is a function which will be implemented in commands.js
commands.evaluateCmd(userInput);
userInput = userInput.toString().trim();

//prompt the user for input
//The stdin 'data' event triggers after a user types in a line
})
const commands = require("./commands.js");
process.stdin.on('data', (userInput) =>{
process.stdout.write('prompt > ');

sort returns the selected file sorted alphabetically by line
wc commands.js > 47 116 1232
wc returns the number of newlines,words and byte count 

uniq sorts each line in a file and only returns different lines

2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. 
Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

sort bash.js | wc
12    42    382
